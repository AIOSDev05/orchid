# orchid

Orchid is a desktop environment for the modern world. Composed similar to a web browser, it has many advantages:
1. Omni-search - There is a centralized search bar that allows you to find anything and everything you're looking for. From games to news to email contents, everything is available by keyword search.
2. Bookmarks bar - Rather than a cluttered desktop, Orchid provides a list of bookmarks that serve as shortcuts to websites, apps, and folders.
3. Window tabs - Tabs replace the typical taskbar/panel setup and make it easy to keep track of what's open, where everything is, and navigating between pages.
4. TODO: List other features. Add pictures.
